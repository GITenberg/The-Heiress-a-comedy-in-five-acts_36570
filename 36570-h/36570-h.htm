<h2>
    REMARKS.
</h2>

<p>
The author of this play was an elegant writer, and a brave soldier&mdash;yet,
as an author he had faults, and as a general failures. His life was
eventful; and he appears to have had, among his other qualities, that
of patient philosophy: or if, in the warmth of youth, or pride of
manhood, he was ever elated by prosperity, it is certain he bore adversity
with cheerful resignation; that adversity, which is more formidable to
the ambitious, than poverty to the luxurious&mdash;disappointment of expected
renown.
</p>
<p>
Secret love, and clandestine marriage, composed the first acts of that
tragi-comedy, called his life. His cultivated mind, and endearing
manners, reconciled, in a short time, the noble house of Derby to his
stolen union with Lady Charlotte Stanley: her father, the late Earl of
Derby, acknowledged him for his son-in-law; while the present Earl
considered him, not only as his uncle, but his friend<a href="#note-1" name="noteref-1"><small> 1</small></a>.
</p>
<p>
The author was, at that period, but a subaltern in the army. The
patronage of his new relations, more

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page4" name="page4"></a>[4]</span>

                                      than his own merit, it is probable,
obtained him higher rank. He was, however, possessed of talents for a
general, and those talents were occasionally rewarded with success. But
his misfortunes in battle have been accompanied by circumstances more
memorable than his victories&mdash;the latter were but of slight or partial
consequence; his defeat at Saratoga was of great and direful import.
</p>
<p>
He sent an able, and most pathetic account, from America, of the
surrender of his whole army&mdash;it was correctly written, and the style
charmed every reader&mdash;but he had better have beaten the enemy, and
mis-spelt every word of his dispatch; for so, probably, the great Duke
of Marlborough would have done, both by one and the other.
</p>
<p>
General Burgoyne appears to have been a man capable of performing all
things that did not require absolute genius. He was complete in
mediocrity, A valiant, but not always a skilful, soldier; an elegant,
but sometimes an insipid, writer.
</p>
<p>
When the comedy of "The Heiress" was first acted, it was compared, and
preferred by some persons, to "The School for Scandal." It attracted
vast sums of money from the east, as well as the west part of the
metropolis;&mdash;but was more justly appreciated when the season of acting
was over, and the playhouses closed.
</p>
<p>
Still, it is a production which claims high respect, from a degree of
refinement which pervades the whole work; from the peculiar situation
of its author; and from other circumstances closely connected with its

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page5" name="page5"></a>[5]</span>

 performance on the stage.&mdash;"The Heiress" is dedicated to the Earl of
Derby; and the present Countess of Derby was the Lady Emily of the
drama when it was first acted.
</p>
<p>
The author, in his Preface, has, with much art, paid a deference to
Miss Farren, by a compliment separate from her brother and sister
performers; at the same time, wisely taking care not to excite their
jealousy, while he soothed the partiality of his noble relation. He
thanks and praises her merely for speaking his Epilogue, in which, of
course, no other performer had a claim to his acknowledgments.
</p>
<p>
Lieutenant General Burgoyne is the author of another comedy, called
"The Maid of the Oaks," and the excellent farce of "Bon Ton."&mdash;He was
enamoured of the stage, and was at a play, in the little theatre of the
Haymarket, the night previous to that on which he died suddenly, in the
summer of 1792.
</p>
<p>
He was a Privy Counsellor, Colonel of the 4th regiment of foot, and
Member of Parliament for Preston, in Lancashire. He had held many
offices of great emolument; but having resigned them all about the time
he wrote this comedy, he was at length rather a confirmation of, than
an exception to, the adage&mdash;an author is seldom wealthy.
</p>

The late Earl of Derby was grandfather to the present
Earl, his son having died before him.

perfect phrase addressed?
</p>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Blandish.</i> To one worth the pains, I can tell you&mdash;Miss Alscrip.
</p>
<p>
<i>Blandish.</i> What, sensibility to Miss Alscrip! My dear sister, this is
too much, even in your own way: had you run changes upon her fortune,
stocks, bonds, and mortgages; upon Lord Gayville's coronet at her feet,
or forty other coronets, to make footballs of if she pleased,&mdash;it would
have been plausible; but the quality you have selected&mdash;&mdash;

flattery is more persuasive&mdash;that's my maxim.
</p>
<p>
<i>Blandish.</i> And mine also, but I don't try it quite so
high&mdash;Sensibility to Miss Alscrip! you might as well have applied it to
her uncle's pig-iron, from which she derives her first fifty thousand;
or the harder heart of the old usurer, her father, from which she
expects the second. But come, <span class="dir-i">[<i>Rings.</i>]</span> to the business of the morning.

</p>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Blandish.</i> These are the attentions that establish valuable
friendships in female life. By adapting myself to the whims of one,
submitting to the jest of another, assisting the little plots of a
third, and taking part against the husbands with all, I am become an
absolute essential in the polite world; the very soul of every
fashionable party in town or country.
</p>
<p>
<i>Blandish.</i> The country! Pshaw! Time thrown away.
</p>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Blandish.</i> Time thrown away! As if women of fashion left London,
to turn freckled shepherdesses.&mdash;No, no; cards, cards and backgammon,
are the delights of rural life; and, slightly as you may think of my
skill, at the year's end I am no inconsiderable sharer in the pin-money
of my society.
</p>
<p>
<i>Blandish.</i> A paltry resource&mdash;&mdash;Gambling is a damned trade, and I have
done with it.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page10" name="page10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<p>
<i>Mrs. Blandish.</i> Indeed!
</p>
<p>
<i>Blandish.</i> Yes; 'twas high time.&mdash;The women don't pay; and as for the
men, the age grows circumspect in proportion to its poverty. It's odds
but one loses a character to establish a debt, and must fight a duel to
obtain the payment. I have a thousand better plans, but two principal
ones; and I am only at a loss which to chuse.
</p>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Blandish.</i> Out with them, I beseech you.
</p>
<p>
<i>Blandish.</i> Whether I shall marry my friend's intended bride, or his
sister.
</p>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Blandish.</i> Marry his intended bride?&mdash;&mdash; What, pig-iron and
usury?&mdash;Your opinion of her must advance your addresses admirably.
</p>
<p>
<i>Blandish.</i> My lord's opinion of her will advance them; he can't bear
the sight of her, and, in defiance of his uncle, Sir Clement Flint's,
eagerness for the match, is running mad after an adventure, which I,
who am his confidant, shall keep going till I determine.&mdash;There's news
for you.
</p>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Blandish.</i> And his sister, Lady Emily, the alternative! The first
match in England, in beauty, wit, and accomplishment.
</p>
<p>
<i>Blandish.</i> Pooh! A fig for her personal charms; she will bring me
connexion that would soon supply fortune; the other would bring fortune
enough to make connexion unnecessary.
</p>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Blandish.</i> And as to the certainty of success with the one or the
other&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Blandish.</i> Success!&mdash;Are they not women?&mdash;But I must away. And first
for Lord Gayville, and his fellow student, Clifford.
</p>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Blandish.</i> Apropos! Look well to Clifford. Lady Emily and he were
acquainted at the age of first impressions.
</p>
<p>
<i>Blandish.</i> I dare say he always meant to be the complete friend of the
family; for, besides his design on Lady Emily, his game, I find, has
been to work

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page11" name="page11"></a>[11]</span>

 upon Lord Gayville's understanding; he thinks he must finally establish
himself in his esteem, by inexorably opposing all his follies.&mdash;Poor
simpleton!&mdash;Now, my touch of opposition goes only to enhance the value
of my acquiescence. So adieu for the morning&mdash;You to Miss Alscrip, with
an unction of flattery, fit for a house-painter's brush; I to Sir
Clement, and his family, with a composition as delicate as ether, and
to be applied with the point of a feather.

<p class="dir-c">
<i>Enter <span class="sc">Lord Gayville</span> and <span class="sc">Mr. Clifford</span>.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Lord G.</i> My dear Clifford, urge me no more. How can a man of your
liberality of sentiment descend to be the advocate of my uncle's family
avarice?
</p>
<p>
<i>Cliff.</i> My lord, you do not live for yourself. You have an ancient
name and title to support.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page12" name="page12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p>
<i>Lord G.</i> Preposterous policy! Whenever the father builds, games, or
electioneers, the heir and title roust go to market. Oh, the happy
families Sir Clement Flint will enumerate, where this practice has
prevailed for centuries; and the estate been improved in every
generation, though specifically spent by each individual!
</p>
<p>
<i>Cliff.</i> But you thought with him a month ago, and wrote with transport
of the match&mdash;"Whenever I think of Miss Alscrip, visions of equipage
and splendour, villas and hotels, the delights of independence and
profuseness, dance in my imagination."
</p>
<p>
<i>Lord G.</i> It is true, I was that dissipated, fashionable wretch.
</p>
<p>
<i>Cliff.</i> Come, this reserve betrays a consciousness of having acted
wrong: You would not hide what would give me pleasure: But I'll not be
officious.
</p>
<p>
<i>Lord G.</i> Hear me without severity, and I'll tell you all. Such a
woman, such an assemblage of all that's lovely in the sex!&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Cliff.</i> Well, but&mdash;the who, the how, the where?
</p>
<p>
<i>Lord G.</i> I met her walking, and alone; and, indeed, so humbly
circumstanced as to carry a parcel in her own hand.
</p>
<p>
<i>Cliff.</i> I cannot but smile at this opening of your adventure.&mdash;But
proceed.
</p>
<p>
<i>Lord G.</i> Her dress was such as a judicious painter would chuse to
characterise modesty. But natural grace and elegance stole upon the
observation, and, through the simplicity of a quaker, showed all we
could conceive of a goddess. I gazed, and turned idolater.

     boot, a switch, and round hat&mdash;the things that escape from counters
and writing desks, to disturb public places, insult foreigners, and
put modest women out of countenance. I had no difficulty in the rescue.
</p>
<p>
<i>Cliff.</i> And, having silenced the dragon, in the true spirit of
chivalry, you conducted the damsel to her castle.
</p>
<p>
<i>Lord G.</i> The utmost I could obtain was leave to put her into a hackney
coach, which I followed unperceived, and lodged her in the house of an
obscure milliner, in a bye street, whose favour was soon conciliated by
a few guineas. I almost lived in the house; and often, when I was not
suspected to be there, passed whole hours listening to a voice, that
would have captivated my very soul, though it had been her only
attraction. At last&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Cliff.</i> What is to follow?
</p>
<p>
<i>Lord G.</i> By the persuasions of the woman, who laughed at my scruples
with an unknown girl, a lodger upon a second floor, I hid myself in the
closet of her apartment: and the practised trader assured me, I had
nothing to fear from the interruption of the family.
</p>
<p>
<i>Cliff.</i> Oh, for shame, my lord! whatever may be the end of your
adventure, such means were very much below you.
</p>
<p>
<i>Lord G.</i> I confess it, and have been punished. Upon the discovery of
me, fear, indignation, and resolution, agitated the whole frame of the
sweet girl by turns.&mdash;I should as soon have committed sacrilege, as
have offered an affront to her person.&mdash;Confused&mdash;overpowered&mdash;I
stammered out a few incoherent words&mdash;Interest in her
fortune&mdash;respect&mdash;entreaty of forgiveness&mdash;and left her, to detest me.
</p>

a double precipice; on one side impelled by folly, on the other&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Lord G.</i> Hold, Clifford, I am not prepared for so much admonition.
Your tone is changed since our separation; you seem to drop the
companion, and assume the governor.

I have again found her&mdash;she is in a house of equal retirement, but of
very different character, in the city, and inaccessible. I have wrote
to her, and knowing her to be distressed, I have enclosed bank bills
for two hundred pounds, the acceptance of which I have urged with all
the delicacy I am master of, and, by Heaven! without a purpose of
corruption.

my ambition has been to be loved for my own sake, I have been jealous
of my title.

trace his fugitive?

this wild intrigue, till the girl is put into your arms.

upon the determination of never being her husband. I may despise and

</p>
<p class="dir-c">
<i>Enter <span class="sc">Mrs. Sagely</span> and <span class="sc">Miss Alton</span>.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Mrs. Sagely.</i> Indeed, Miss Alton, (since you are resolved to continue
that name) you may bless yourself for finding me out in this
wilderness.&mdash;Wilderness! this town is ten times more dangerous to youth
and innocence: every man you meet is a wolf.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page18" name="page18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p>
<i>Miss Alton.</i> Dear madam, I see you dwell upon my indiscretion in
flying to London; but remember the safeguard I expected to find
here. How cruel was the disappointment! how dangerous have been the
consequences! I thought the chance happy that threw a retired lodging
in my way: I was upon my guard against the other sex, but for my own
to be treacherous to an unfortunate&mdash;could I expect it?
</p>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Sagely.</i> Suspect every body, if you would be safe&mdash;but most of
all suspect yourself. Ah, my pretty truant&mdash;the heart, that is so
violent in its aversions, is in sad danger of being the same in its
affections, depend upon it.
</p>
<p>
<i>Miss Alton.</i> Let them spring from a just esteem, and you will absolve
me: my aversion was to the character of the wretch I was threatened
with&mdash;can you reprove me?
</p>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Sagely.</i> And tell me truly now; do you feel the same detestation
for this worse character you have made acquaintance with? This
rake&mdash;this abominable Heartly?&mdash;&mdash;Ah, child, your look is suspicious.
</p>
<p>
<i>Miss Alton.</i> Madam, I have not a thought, that I will not sincerely
lay open to you. Mr. Heartly is made to please, and to be avoided; I
resent his attempts, and desire never to see him more&mdash;his discovery of
me here; his letters, his offers have greatly alarmed me. I conjure you
lose not an hour in placing me under the sort of protection I solicited.
</p>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Sagely.</i> If you are resolved, I believe I can serve you. Miss
Alscrip, the great heiress, (you may have heard of the name in your
family) has been inquiring among decayed gentry for a companion. She
is too fine a lady to bear to be alone, and perhaps does not look to a
husband's company as a certain dependence. Your musical talents will be
a great recommendation&mdash;She is already apprized, and a line from me
will introduce you.

views upon you, that way, than upon my grandmother&mdash;My proposals are of
a quite different nature.

<p>
<i>Mrs. Sagely.</i> Of a different nature? Why you audacious varlet! Here,

respect for you, that will set at nought all the personal temptations
about you, depend upon it, powerful as they are&mdash;And as for the young
lady, my purpose is only that you shall guard her safe.&mdash;I would offer
you a pretty snug house in a pleasant quarter of the town, where you
two would be much more commodiously lodged&mdash;the furniture new, and in
the prettiest taste&mdash;A neat little sideboard of plate&mdash;a black boy,
with a turban to wait upon you&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Mrs. Sagely.</i> And for what purpose am I to be bribed? I am above it,
sirrah. I have but a pittance, 'tis true, and heavy outgoings&mdash;My
husband's decayed bookkeeper to maintain, and poor old Smiler, that
so many years together drew our whole family in a chaise&mdash;Heavy
charges&mdash;but by cutting off my luxuries, and stopping up a few windows,
I can jog on, and scorn to be beholden to you, or him that sent you.

principle that&mdash;"honesty is the best policy."&mdash;Self-interest is the
great end of life, says human nature&mdash;Honesty is a better agent than
craft, says proverb.
</p>
<p>
<i>Cliff.</i> But as for ingenuous, or purely disinterested motives&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir C.</i> Clifford, do you mean to laugh at me?
</p>
<p>
<i>Cliff.</i> What is your opinion, Lady Emily?
</p>
<p>
<i>Lady E.</i> <span class="dir-i">[<i>Endeavouring again at Vivacity.</i>]</span> That there may be such:
but it's odds they are troublesome or insipid. Pure ingenuousness, I
take it, is a rugged sort of thing, which scarcely will bear the polish
of common civility; and for disinterestedness&mdash;young people sometimes
set out with it; but it is like travelling upon a broken spring&mdash;one is
glad to get it mended at the next stage.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page24" name="page24"></a>[24]</span></p>

<p>
<i>Sir C.</i> Emily, I protest you seem to study after me; proceed, child,
and we will read together every character that comes in our way.
</p>
<p>
<i>Lady E.</i> Read one's acquaintance&mdash;&mdash;delightful! What romances, novels,
satires, and mock heroics present themselves to my imagination! Our
young men are flimsy essays; old ones, political pamphlets; coquets,
fugitive pieces; and fashionable beauties, a compilation of advertised
perfumery, essence of pearl, milk of roses, and Olympian dew.&mdash;&mdash;Lord,
I should now and then though turn over an acquaintance with a sort of
fear and trembling.
</p>
<p>
<i>Cliff.</i> How so?
</p>
<p>
<i>Lady E.</i> Lest one should pop unaware upon something one should not,
like a naughty speech in an old comedy; but it is only skipping what
would make one blush.
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir C.</i> Or if you did not skip, when a woman reads by herself, and to
herself, there are wicked philosophers, who doubt whether her blushes
are very troublesome.
</p>
<p>
<i>Lady E.</i> <span class="dir-i">[<i>To <span class="sc">Sir Clement</span>.</i>]</span> Do you know now that for that
speech of yours&mdash;and for that saucy smile of yours, <span class="dir-i">[<i>To
<span class="sc">Clifford</span>.</i>]</span> I am strongly tempted to read you both aloud!
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir C.</i> Come try&mdash;&mdash;I'll be the first to open the book.
</p>
<p>
<i>Lady E.</i> A treatise of the Houyhnhnms, after the manner of Swift,
tending to make us odious to ourselves, and to extract morose mirth
from our imperfections.&mdash;<span class="dir-i">[<i>Turning to <span class="sc">Clifford</span>.</i>]</span> Contrasted
with an exposition of ancient morality addressed to the moderns: a
chimerical attempt upon an obsolete subject.
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir C.</i> Clifford! we must double down that page. And now we'll have a
specimen of her Ladyship.
</p>
<p>
<i>Lady E.</i> I'll give it you myself, and with justice; Which is more than
either of you would.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page25" name="page25"></a>[25]</span></p>

<p>
<i>Sir C.</i> And without skipping.
</p>
<p>
<i>Lady E.</i> Thus then; a light, airy, fantastic sketch of genteel manners
as they are; with a little endeavour at what they ought to be&mdash;rather
entertaining than instructive, not without art, but sparing in the use
of it&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir C.</i> But the passions, Emily. Do not forget what should stand in
the foreground of a female treatise.
</p>
<p>
<i>Lady E.</i> They abound: but mixed and blended cleverly enough to prevent
any from predominating; like the colours of a shot lutestring, that
change as you look at it sideways or full: they are sometimes brightened
by vivacity, and now and then subject to a shade of caprice&mdash;but
meaning no ill&mdash;not afraid of a Critical Review: and thus, gentlemen, I
present myself to you fresh from the press, and I hope not inelegantly
bound.
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir C.</i> Altogether making a perfectly desirable companion for the
closet: I am sure, Clifford, you will agree with me. Gad we are got
into such a pleasant freedom with each other, it is a pity to separate
while any curiosity remains in the company. Pr'ythee, Clifford, satisfy
me a little as to your history. Old Lord Hardacre, if I am rightly
informed, disinherited your father, his second son.
</p>
<p>
<i>Cliff.</i> For the very marriage we have been speaking of. The little
fortune my father could call his own was sunk before his death, as a
provision for my mother; upon an idea that whatever resentment he might
personally have incurred, it would not be extended to an innocent
offspring.
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir C.</i> A very silly confidence. How readily now, should you and I,
Emily, have discovered in a sensible old man, the irreconcileable
offence of a marriage of the passions&mdash;&mdash;You understand me?
</p>
<p>
<i>Lady E.</i> Perfectly! <span class="dir-i">[<i>Aside.</i>]</span> Old petrifaction, your hints always
speak forcibly.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page26" name="page26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p>
<i>Sir C.</i> But your uncle, the present Lord, made amends?
</p>
<p>
<i>Cliff.</i> Amply. He offered to send me from Cambridge to an academy in
Germany, to fit me for foreign service: Well judging that a cannon ball
was a fair and quick provision for a poor relation.
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir C.</i> Upon my word I have known uncles less considerate.
</p>
<p>
<i>Cliff.</i> When Lord Gayville's friendship, and your indulgence, made me
the companion of his travels, Lord Hardacre's undivided cares devolved
upon my sister: whose whole independent possession, at my mother's
death, was five hundred pounds&mdash;&mdash;All our education had permitted that
unhappy parent to lay by.
</p>
<p>
<i>Lady E.</i> Oh, for an act of justice and benevolence, to reconcile me to
the odious man! Tell me this instant what did he do for Miss Clifford?
</p>
<p>
<i>Cliff.</i> He bestowed upon her forty pounds a-year, upon condition that
she resided with one of his dependents in a remote county, to save the
family from disgrace; and that allowance, when I heard last from her,
he had threatened to withdraw upon her refusing a detestable match he
had endeavoured to force upon her.
</p>
<p>
<i>Lady E.</i> Poor girl!
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir C.</i> Upon my word an interesting story, and told with pathetic
effect.&mdash;Emily, you look grave, child.
</p>
<p>
<i>Lady E.</i> <span class="dir-i">[<i>Aside.</i>]</span> I shall not own it however. <span class="dir-i">[<i>To him.</i>]</span> For once,
my dear uncle, you want your spectacles. My thoughts are on a diverting
subject&mdash;My first visit to Miss Alscrip; to take a near view of that
collection of charms destined to my happy brother.
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir C.</i> You need not go out of the room for that purpose. The schedule
of an heiress's fortune is a compendium of her merits, and the true
security for marriage happiness.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page27" name="page27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<p>
<i>Lady E.</i> I am sure I guess at your system&mdash;That union must be most
wise, which has wealth to support it, and no affections to disturb it.
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir C.</i> Right.
</p>
<p>
<i>Lady E.</i> That makes a divorce the first promise of wedlock; and
widowhood the best blessing of life; that separates the interest of
husband, wife, and child&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir C.</i> To establish the independent comfort of all&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Lady E.</i> Upon the broad basis of family hatred. Excellent, my dear
uncle, excellent indeed; and upon that principle, though the lady is
likely to be your niece, and my sister, I am sure you will have no
objection to my laughing at her a little.
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir C.</i> You'll be puzzled to make her more ridiculous than I think
her. What is your plan?
</p>
<p>
<i>Lady E.</i> Why, though her pride is to be thought a leader in fashions,
she is sometimes a servile copyist. Blandish tells me I am her principal
model; and what is most provoking, she is intent upon catching my
manner as well as my dress, which she exaggerates to an excess that
vexes me. Now if she will take me in shade, I'll give her a new
outline, I am resolved; and if I do not make her a caricature for
a printshop&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Cliff.</i> Will all this be strictly consistent with your goodnature,
Lady Emily?
</p>
<p>
<i>Lady E.</i> No, nor I don't know when I shall do any thing consistent
with it again, except leaving you two critics to a better subject than
your humble servant.

at home only three days, and have hardly seen him since I came.
</p>
<p>

foreign experience. After rambling half the world over without harm, he
is caught, like a travelled woodcock, at his landing.
</p>

put him candidly to the test? I'll be bound for his ingenuousness not
to withold any confession you may require.

than to me in a month, for all that; come, Clifford, look as you ought

you will make me your friend, and how grateful I may be if you will

affluence and content to misery and imprisonment; and it adds, that the

              am in no haste. On the contrary, I think the occasion
fortunate that allows me to begin an acquaintance with a person of so
amiable an appearance. I don't know whether that pert foreigner has led
me into an error&mdash;but without being too inquisitive, may I ask if you
make any part of this family?
</p>
<p>
<i>Miss Alton.</i> Madam, I am under Miss Alscrip's protection: I imagine I
am represented as her dependent: I am not ashamed of humble circumstances,
that are not the consequences of indiscretion.
</p>
<p>
<i>Lady E.</i> That with such claims to respect you should be in any
circumstances of humiliation, is a disgrace to the age we live in.
</p>
<p>
<i>Miss Alton.</i> Madam, my humiliation (if such it be) is just. Perhaps
I have been too proud, and my heart required this self-correction.
A life of retired industry might have been more pleasing to me; but
an orphan&mdash;a stranger&mdash;ignorant and diffident, I preferred my present
situation, as one less exposed to misrepresentation. <span class="dir-i">[<i>Bell rings.</i>]</span>

ladyship.

this&mdash;&mdash;what delicacy of sentiment&mdash;what softness of manners! and how
well do these qualities accord with that sigh for Clifford! she has
been proud&mdash;proud of what?&mdash;of Clifford's love. It is too plain. But
then to account for her present condition?&mdash;He has betrayed and
abandoned her&mdash;too plain again, I fear.&mdash;She talked too of a
self-corrected heart&mdash;take example, Emily, and recall thine from an
object, which it ought more than ever to renounce. But here come the
Alscrip and her friend: lud! lud! lud! how shall I recover my spirits!
I must attempt it, and if I lose my present thoughts in a trial of
extravagance, be it of theirs or my own, it will be a happy expedient.

has been adopted for years.

projected the revival of a cap: read a page in the trials of Temper;

been robbed of his heart, and I see the felony in your looks. Will you
confess, or must I arrest you?

your own is safe?
</p>
<p>

with that also?
</p>
<p>

as the Jews do stolen goods, to prevent their being reclaimed.
</p>
<p>

fancy outruns her art! But are you really the young lady, that's
admitted into this family, as companion to Miss Alscrip?
</p>
<p>
<i>Tiff.</i> Sir, if you mean the young lady, who, however undeservingly, is
flatteringly called the flower of this family&mdash;who sometimes extracts
notice from these windows; and to be sure has been followed home by
gentlemen against her inclinations&mdash;sir, you are not mistaken.
</p>
<p>
<i>Cliff.</i> <span class="dir-i">[<i>Aside.</i>]</span> Sure it has been Gayville's madness or amusement
then to describe her by contraries.
</p>
<p>
<i>Tiff.</i> I hope, sir, you are not offended? I would not be impertinent,
though I am not so tasteless as to be shy.
</p>
<p>
<i>Cliff.</i> Offended, my dear? I am quite charmed, I assure you. And so
without further shyness on either part, let us be free upon the subject
I had to talk over with you. You surely are not looking to lasting
connexions?

a thing for the world, but you are a man of honour, and I am sure would
not give bad advice to a poor girl who is but a novice&mdash;and so, sir,

<p>

can make no impression on Lord Gayville's mind; and I doubt not but a
silk-gown and a lottery-ticket, had they been offered as an ultimatum,
would have purchased her person.
</p>
<p>

erroneous opinions of people's pretensions? Interest and foolish
passion inspire strange notions&mdash;as one or the other prevails, we are
brought to look so low, or so high&mdash;

honour to our aid&mdash;&mdash;

what is right.

<i>Cliff.</i> Sir, I would please you if I could&mdash;I am thinking of a scheme
to restore Lord Gayville to his senses, without violence or injury to
any one of the parties.
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir C.</i> Let me hear it.
</p>
<p>
<i>Cliff.</i> Why, the wench being cut short of marketing by word of mouth,
desired me to write proposals.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page63" name="page63"></a>[63]</span>

                               I am inclined to do so. We will show the
answer to Lord Gayville, and, depend upon it, there will be character
enough displayed to cure him of the sentimental part of his attachment.

peremptory show of honour would overpower prejudices. Thank Heaven, my
opinions of knavery are convictions!

<p>
<i>Lord G.</i> Not here! I am sure I marked the hour as well as the place,
precisely in my note. <span class="dir-i">[<i>Walks about.</i>]</span> Had I been told three days ago,
that I should have been the appellant in a premeditated duel, I should
have thought it an insult upon my principles&mdash;That Clifford should be

both

</p>
<p>
<i>Cliff.</i> <span class="dir-i">[<i>Bows in Silence.</i>]</span>
</p>
<p>
<i>Lord G.</i> That ceremonial would grace an encounter of punctilio, but
applies ill to the terms upon which I have called you here.
</p>
<p>
<i>Cliff.</i> What terms are those, my lord?
</p>
<p>
<i>Lord G.</i> Vengeance! Ample, final vengeance! Draw, sir.
</p>
<p>
<i>Cliff.</i> No, my lord; my sword is reserved for more becoming purposes:
It is not the instrument of passion; and has yet been untried in a
dispute with my friend.
</p>
<p>
<i>Lord G.</i> But why is it not ready for a different trial, the
vindication of perfidy, the blackest species of perfidy, that ever the
malignant enemy of mankind infused into the human breast&mdash;perfidy to
the friend who loved and trusted you, and in the nearest interests of
his heart.
</p>
<p>
<i>Cliff.</i> Take care, my lord; should my blood boil like yours, and it
is rising fast, you know not the punishment that awaits you. I came
temperate, your gross provocation and thirst of blood make temperance
appear disgrace&mdash;I am tempted to take a revenge&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Lord G.</i> <span class="dir-i">[<i>Draws.</i>]</span> The means are ready. Come, sir, you are to give an
example of qualities generally held incompatible&mdash;bravery and dishonour.
</p>
<p>
<i>Cliff.</i> Another such a word, and by Heaven!&mdash;How have I deserved this
opinion?
</p>
<p>
<i>Lord G.</i> Ask your conscience&mdash;Under the mask of friendship you have
held a secret intercourse with the woman I adore; you have supplanted
me in her affections, you have robbed me of the very charm of my
life&mdash;can you deny it?
</p>

that would excuse or atone&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Lord G.</i> Death&mdash;Death only&mdash;no abject submission&mdash;no compromise for
infamy&mdash;chuse instantly&mdash;and save yourself from the only stretch of
baseness left&mdash;the invention of falsehood to palliate.&mdash;

remember me.

<i>Lord G.</i> I say so still&mdash;but upon an equal pledge&mdash;I am no assassin.
</p>
<p>
<i>Cliff.</i> <span class="dir-i">[<i>With great Emotion.</i>]</span> If to strike at the heart of your
friend, more deeply than that poor instrument in your hand could do,
makes an assassin, you have been one already.
</p>
<p>

avowed such abominable practices&mdash;
</p>
<p>

woman you adore&mdash;her affections are riveted to me. I have removed her
from your sight; secured her from your recovery&mdash;

</p>
<p>
<i>Cliff.</i> I have done it to save unguarded beauty; to save unprotected
innocence; to save&mdash;a sister.

<p>

complete.

</p>
<p>
<i>Lord G.</i> Why did you keep the secret from me?
</p>
<p>
<i>Cliff.</i> I knew it not myself, till the strange concurrence of
circumstances, to which you were in part witness a few hours since,
brought it to light. I meant to impart to you the discovery, when my
temper took fire&mdash;Let us bury our mutual errors in the thought, that we
now for life are friends.
</p>
<p>

doubly, doubly ratify it. Unite me to your charming sister; accept
the hand of Lady Emily in return&mdash;her heart I have discovered to be
yours&mdash;&mdash;We'll leave the world to the sordid and the tasteless; let an
Alscrip, or a Sir Clement Flint, wander after the phantom of happiness,
we shall find her real retreat, and hold her by the bonds she covets,
virtue, love, and friendship.

insuperable.
</p>
<p>

<p>

prince; nor will I&mdash;though doting on Lady Emily with a passion like
your own, bear the idea of a clandestine union in a family, to whom
I am bound by obligation and trust. Indeed, my lord, without Sir
Clement's consent, you must think no more of my sister.
</p>
<p>
<i>Lord G.</i> Stern stoic, but I will, and not clandestinely; I'll
instantly to Sir Clement.
</p>
<p>

not to stir in this business.

poor old clear-sight, I hope he has projected a reconciliation.
</p>
<p>

that was made for them!
</p>
<p>
<i>Miss Als.</i> Returned, Blandish? I desire you will not insinuate it ever

temper of an heiress of my class, was to be ruffled by the loss of a
paltry earl&mdash;I have been highly diverted with what has passed from

you carry it to must be the example.

done nothing but laugh&mdash;nay, it is true too.

chuse she shall have run away with?

the curiosity to one story which may be disproved; uncertainty leaves
it open to a hundred, and makes them all probable. But I hear some of
the company upon the stairs: Now, Blandish&mdash;You shall be witness to the

Miss Alscrip's amiable disposition, placed against the abatement of her
fortune, is a matter of the most easy computation; and to decide the

amicable endeavour here. <span class="dir-i">[<i>To <span class="sc">Miss Alscrip</span>.</i>]</span> And really, Miss
Alscrip, I see no reason for your being dispirited; there may be

 many ready-made titles at market, within the reach of your purse. Or,
why should not a woman of your consequence originate her own splendour?
there's an old admirer of mine&mdash;He would make a very pretty lord&mdash;and
indeed, would contribute something on his own part, to ease the
purchase&mdash;The Blandish family is well with all administrations, and a
new coronet is always as big again as an old one. I don't see how you
could lay out part of your independency to more advantage.

look a little into things before I agree to the bargain.

</p>
<p>
<i>Lady E.</i> Depend upon it, Miss Alscrip, your place will be found
exactly where it ought to be. The public eye, in this country, is never
long deceived&mdash;Believe me&mdash;and cherish obscurity&mdash;Title may bring
forward merits, but it also places our defects in horrid relief.

And now, sir, whatever may be your determinations towards me&mdash;here are
pretensions you may patronize without breach of discretion. The estate
which devolves to my friend&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Rightly.</i> To prevent errors&mdash;is not his to bestow.
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir C.</i> What now&mdash;more flaws?
</p>
<p>
<i>Rightly.</i> The estate was his beyond the reach of controversy: but
before he was truly sure of it, on his way to Hyde-Park, did this
spendthrift, by a stroke of his pen, divest himself of every
shilling&mdash;Here is the covenant by which he binds himself to

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page90" name="page90"></a>[90]</span>

 execute proper conveyances as soon as the necessary forms can be gone
through.
</p>
<p>
<i>Lord G.</i> And in favour of whom is this desperate act?
</p>
<p>
<i>Rightly.</i> Of a most dangerous seducer&mdash;a little mercenary, that, when
she gets hold of the heart, does not leave an atom of it our own.
</p>

her before any court in the universe.
</p>
<p>
<i>Lady E.</i> Glorious&mdash;matchless Clifford!
</p>
<p>
<i>Miss Cliff.</i> Brother, this must not be.
</p>
<p>
<i>Cliff.</i> Your pardon, my dear Harriet, it is done. Sir Clement, my
sister's fortune is still far short of what you expected with Miss
Alscrip; for that deficiency, I have only to offer the virtues Lord
Gayville has proved, and the affection she found it easier to control,
than to conceal. If you will receive her, thus circumstanced, into your
family, mine has been an acquisition indeed.
</p>
<p>
<i>Lady E.</i> <span class="dir-i">[<i>Coming up to <span class="sc">Sir Clement</span>.</i>]</span> Now, sir, where's the
suspicion! Where is now the ruling principle that governs mankind!
Through what perspective, by what trial, will you find self-interest
here? What, not one pithy word to mock my credulity!&mdash;Alas! poor
Yorick&mdash;quite chop-fallen.&mdash;Forgive me, sir, I own I am agitated to
extravagance&mdash;You found me disconcerted at the first discovery; I am
delighted at the last; there's a problem of my disposition worthy your
solving.

with that paper in your hand.

Clement</span> looks it over, and tears it.</i>]</span> What do you mean, sir?
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir C.</i> To cancel the obligation, and pay the equivalent

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page91" name="page91"></a>[91]</span>

 to Gayville;
or if Clifford will have his own way, and become a beggar by renewing
it, to make an heiress of my own for his reparation&mdash;and there she
stands. <span class="dir-i">[<i>Pointing to <span class="sc">Lady Emily</span>.</i>]</span> With sensibility and
vivacity so uncommonly blended, that they extract benevolence wherever
it exists, and create it where it never was before&mdash;Your point is
carried&mdash;You may both fall upon your knees, for the consent of the
ladies.
</p>
<p>
<i>Lord G.</i> <span class="dir-i">[<i>To <span class="sc">Miss Clifford</span>.</i>]</span> In this happy moment, let my
errors be forgot, and my love alone remembered.
</p>
<p>
<i>Miss Cliff.</i> With these sanctions for my avowal&mdash;I will not deny that
I saw and felt the sincerity of your attachment, from the time it was
capable of being restrained by respect.
</p>
<p>
<i>Cliff.</i> Words are wanting, Lady Emily&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Lady E.</i> I wish they may with all my heart, but it is generally
remarked that wanting words, is the beginning of a florid set
speech&mdash;To be serious, Clifford&mdash;We want but little explanation on
either side&mdash;Sir Clement will tell you how long we have conversed by
our actions. <span class="dir-i">[<i>Gives her Hand.</i>]</span> My dear uncle, how a smile becomes you
in its natural meaning!
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir C.</i> If you think me a convert, you are mistaken: I have ever
believed <i>self</i> to be the predominant principle of the human mind&mdash;My
heart at this instant confirms the doctrine&mdash;There's my problem for
yours, my dear Emily, and may all who hear me agree in this solution&mdash;to
reward the deserving, and make those we love happy, is self-interest
in the extreme.

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
